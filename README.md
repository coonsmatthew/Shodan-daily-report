# Shodan-daily-report
This script will search new Shodan search results and return results in email form. 

The script searches 23 often abused protocols and vulnerable devices and is designed to provide a report for your organization to determine what public devices might be out there. 

At the beginning of the script, there is a section for user set variables. Users must set their organization and the source and destination email addresses they wish the script to use. 

The script was written in Python 2.6.
